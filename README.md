# Bin Packing

Uses approximation algorithms to solve the bin packing problem in three ways:
 1: First Fit
 2: First Fit Decreasing
 3: Best Fit

Displays minimum number of bins needed and time spent processing for each algorithm.

Input is read from a file named 'bin.txt'

Input file is organized as follows:

First line: number of test cases in the file

Next line: capacity of the bins for this test cases

Next line: number of items in this test cases

Next line: the weight of each item, separated by spaces

...repeated for each test case
